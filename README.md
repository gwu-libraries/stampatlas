Combines Atlas.ti codes with F5 transcription timestamps in a spreadsheet

NOT YET COMPLETED

Purpose
-------

Many researchers perform audio or video transcription using the free software F5 and then import their F5 documents into Atlas.ti to perform analysis, coding, etc.  However, when you export the data from Atlas.ti the timestamps from the F5 document are lost, so it is impossible to perform time-based analysis of codes.

This program will read the XML export file from an Atlas.ti Hermeneutic Unit (HU) and match up each quoted line in the HU with that quote's timestamp from an associated F5 text file.  It will spit out the results into an Excel spreadsheet.
